# Model Discrepancy Learning: Synthetic Faces Detection Based on Multi-Reconstruction

![项目配图](images/demo.png)  <!-- 替换为实际图片路径 -->

## Contributions
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
- **Multi-Reconstruction-based Detector**:  
  We propose a novel detector to address the challenging task of distinguishing between real, GAN-generated, and DM-generated faces.
- **ASFD Dataset**:  
  We introduce the **Asian Synthetic Face Dataset (ASFD)** to address the under-representation of Asian synthetic face data, providing valuable support for tasks targeting Asian populations.
- **Experimental Results**:  
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves detection performance and robustness across different generative models.

The ASFD dataset includes:
- High-quality synthetic face images generated by state-of-the-art models (e.g., StyleGAN3, Diffusion Models)
- Balanced distribution of Asian facial features
- Annotations for model discrepancy analysis
